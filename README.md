# youtube-video
Function responsible for receiving a youtube video without the need for the Google API

This class in php was a prototype which I created, with the idea of ​​being able to receive YouTube videos so that the most recent ones come without using its API, I took advantage and saw that I could use the RSS feed of Youtube itself, this class is feeds from the RSS that Youtube itself provides based on the channel id or channel user you provide.
